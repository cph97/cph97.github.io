      <h3>Botanic Pointcloud Composition</h3>
      <p>This video presents a pointcloud composition of various plant structures. The pointclouds were created through photogrammetry and assembled in Blender into a single spatial composition. The animation was produced in TouchDesigner, using real-time point rendering and motion controls.</p>

      <h3>Cactus Scan Visualization</h3>
      <p>This video presents a pointcloud scan of a cactus structure, where each point is represented by an ASCII character instead of a standard particle. The animation was created in TouchDesigner and reacts in real-time to a custom audio signal generated with Sonic Pi.</p>

      <h3>Fragment Composition – Gothic Architecture Space</h3>
      <p>This video shows a single-shot walkthrough of a game environment created in Unreal Engine 5. The space is populated with stylized humanoid figures and dynamically triggered lighting.</p>

      <h3>Multi-Site Pointcloud Composition – Monument Overlap Study</h3>
      <p>This video presents a pointcloud composition based on photogrammetry scans from different architectural monuments, including arches and fountains. The pointclouds were combined in Blender at varying scales and spatial alignments.</p>

      <h3>Multi-Site Pointcloud – Audio-Driven Transformation</h3>
      <p>This video presents a variation of the multi-site composition, where architectural scans respond dynamically to audio signals. Animated in TouchDesigner through scale, position, and opacity modulation.</p>

      <h3>Plasmodium Protein 6E10 – Visualization & Sonification</h3>
      <p>This video presents a mirrored visualization of the Plasmodium protein structure 6E10. The atomic geometry was mapped to sound parameters in Pure Data for real-time sonification.</p>

      <h3>SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein – Simulation & Sonification</h3>
      <p>This video shows a custom OpenMM simulation of SARS-CoV-2's spike protein. Atomic coordinates were mapped to sound frequencies in Pure Data, forming a coordinate-driven audiovisual transformation.</p>

      <h3>Pointcloud Composition – Interior Space</h3>
      <p>This video presents a pointcloud of an interior space, procedurally deformed in TouchDesigner with noise-based displacement to introduce spatial fragmentation.</p>

      <h3>Reflected Plant Structure</h3>
      <p>This pointcloud scan of a plant was mirrored in Blender and made audioreactive in TouchDesigner, driven by custom audio generated in Pure Data.</p>

    <h3>Latent Viral Form – GAN-Derived Protein Morphology with Wave Deformation (SARS-CoV-2)</h3>
    <p>This video presents a synthetic viral structure generated from a custom-trained PointNetGAN model on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein datasets. The latent output, reconstructed as a .pdb-like geometry, was visualized and animated in Blender using wave-based deformations. The result is a pulsating digital morphology — a speculative viral form shaped by data synthesis and artistic manipulation. This project explores how neural networks reinterpret biological patterns, and how movement can reintroduce symbolic agency to data-born forms.</p>

    <h3>Latent Viral Form – GAN-Derived Protein Morphology (HIV Dataset)</h3>
    <p>This image captures a synthetic structure generated through PointNetGAN, trained on point cloud data extracted from viral protein models (PDB). The form shown here deviates from recognizable protein topologies, embodying a latent-space abstraction shaped by learned viral geometries. The output does not replicate biological accuracy, but instead reflects how neural networks interpret structural probability in high-dimensional space. It exists between simulation and speculation — a hallucinatory virological form shaped by data, but free from biochemical constraint.</p>

    <h3>Procedural Weather Simulation – Dynamic Landscape Study</h3>
    <p>This video presents a dynamic landscape and procedural weather simulation built in Unreal Engine 5. The terrain was generated in Gaia using EEG (electroencephalography) data collected from the artist, transforming a moment of mental activity into topographic form. The environment evolves in real time through randomized weather transitions — including sun, rain, storms, and snow — reflecting both internal and external fluctuations. The work explores bio-data-driven landscape design and procedural systems for audiovisual environments.</p>

    <h3>Latent Viral Form – GAN-Derived Protein Morphology (Hepatitis C Virus Dataset)</h3>
    <p>This video presents a speculative protein structure generated from a custom-trained PointNetGAN model using data derived from Hepatitis C virus (HCV) proteins. The GAN was trained on 3D point cloud representations of viral protein geometries, extracted from Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries related to HCV. The shown structure reflects a latent-space interpretation of HCV morphology — not as an accurate replication, but as a generative abstraction of viral spatial properties. The output was reconstructed into a .pdb-like geometry and visualized in Blender. Through this hybrid approach, the work explores synthetic biology as form, asking how data-driven systems reshape our perception of molecular identity and pathogenic aesthetics.</p>

    <h3>Reflected Plant Structure</h3>
    <p>This video presents a pointcloud scan of a plant, mirrored in Blender to enhance its structural symmetry. The composition was animated in TouchDesigner, responding in real time to audio signals generated in Pure Data. This setup explores the interplay between organic geometry and sound-driven transformation in real-time point-based visualization.</p>
